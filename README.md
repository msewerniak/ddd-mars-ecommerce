# ddd-mars-ecommerce

## Purpose

Example e-commerce application build based on Domain Driven Design principles.
The purpose is to present most of DDD building blocks e.g. Value Object, Entity, Aggregate, Domain Event, etc.

## Preparation

I assume you already have Java 17, if not, please install it on your machine.
It is also required to have Groovy installed.

You can install both with [Sdk man](https://sdkman.io)

To install groovy run command `sdk install gradle 4.8`
To install java 17 run command `sdk install java 17.0.2-zulu`

If you prefer to run your tests from IntelliJ IDEA it's useful to install: [Spock IntelliJ IDEA Plugin](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/guide/tutorials/writing-tests-with-spock/spock-intellij-plugin/)

## Build

Standard `mvn clean install` should do the job!
